I am a software engineer, and have worked at (or interned for) Yelp, FireEye, and OpsRamp. I am also very interested in security as well.

You can reach me at [veeralpatel4@gmail.com](mailto:veeralpatel4@gmail.com).

- [Inbox Scanner](https://github.com/veeral-patel/inbox-scanner) - scans your Gmail inbox for public Google Drive and Dropbox URLs, so you can understand what files an attacker will gain access to after compromising your inbox
