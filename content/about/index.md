I am a software engineer, and have worked at (or interned for) Yelp, FireEye, and OpsRamp. I am also very interested in security as well.

You can reach me at [veeralpatel4@gmail.com](mailto:veeralpatel4@gmail.com).

## Projects

- [True Positive](https://github.com/veeral-patel/true-positive) - OSS web application that helps security incident responders manage cases. [See website here.](https://truepositive.netlify.app)

- [Incidents](https://github.com/veeral-patel/incidents) - initial iteration of project above (fewer features and less modern UI)

- [Inbox Scanner](https://github.com/veeral-patel/inbox-scanner) - scans your Gmail inbox for public Google Drive and Dropbox URLs, so you can understand what files an attacker will gain access to after compromising your inbox

- [How to Secure Anything](https://github.com/veeral-patel/how-to-secure-anything) - links to different resources on security engineering. Created when I was looking into that topic.

- [Awesome Risk Quantification](https://github.com/veeral-patel/awesome-risk-quantification) - same but for cybersecurity risk quantification

- [Secret scanner mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/WfTL0uhyUhQeSUzMJOHg3s/Secret-Scanner) - same for a product that scans all your SaaS applications for exposed secrets and lets you build automated playbooks to remediate them
