Welcome! I live in Sunnyvale, CA and work as a fullstack software engineer at [OpsRamp](https://opsramp.com). I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Computer Science degree in December 2018 (decided to graduate a little early, in 2.5 years).

Previously I worked as an incident response consultant at [Mandiant](https://www.fireeye.com/mandiant.html), and interned on [Yelp's](https://yelp.com) Application Security team.

## Projects

- [CISO/Founder Connect](http://connect.securityfounders.org/) - project I'm working on with [Caleb Sima](https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebsima) (CISO at Robinhood). Matches CISOs and founders with each other for angel investing, product feedback, advising, board seats. Fortunate to have some top notch security leaders in the program from great companies including JupiterOne, Redis Labs, Twilio, Google DeepMind, Informatica, and many more.

- [Security Founders Slack](https://securityfounders.org/) - I run a channel in this group that pairs ~80 CISOs and founders for random virtual coffees every two weeks. (Did not create this group, but am a member as I'm fairly interested in working on a security company at some point.)

- [How to Secure Anything](https://github.com/veeral-patel/how-to-secure-anything) (6k stars) - 20+ pages of my notes on how to build secure systems, along with 25+ papers and 15+ book recommendations. The most starred repository [on this topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/security-engineering) (as of June 2021).

- [Awesome Risk Quantification](https://github.com/veeral-patel/awesome-risk-quantification) (390+ stars) - The most popular collection on GitHub of projects, blog posts, books, and talks about cybersecurity risk quantification. Created it as I was reading about the topic, after seeing Netflix's [riskquant project](https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/riskquant)

- [Orchestrator](http://web.archive.org/web/20181211032349/http://getorchestrator.com/) - an (unsuccessful) security automation startup I founded in college. Goal was to build an interactive console that secops staff could use to carry out mundane tasks like blocking domains in OpenDNS and looking up hashes in VirusTotal for them upon request.

- [True Positive](https://truepositive.app) - open source web application I built to help incident responders work together, organize their tasks, track IOCs for complex cases. [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/veeral-patel/true-positive)

- [Incidents](https://github.com/veeral-patel/incidents) - initial iteration of True Positive. Written with Rails with server-rendered HTML and JQuery, then later rewrote True Positive using a Rails API and React, revamping the UI and adding many more features

- [LR Tracker](https://github.com/veeral-patel/lr_tracker) - a simple web app I built at Mandiant to help me track my forensic analyses of different compromised computers

- [Cambridge2Cambridge cyber competition](https://www.cambridgefilmworks.com/cambridge-2-cambridge-cyber-competition-2/) - While in college, had the opportunity to participate in a US-UK CTF competition held at the University of Cambridge in the UK. [Managed to place 2nd individually](https://sa.berkeley.edu/news/2017/10/13/cal-sophomore-veeral-patel-places-2nd-cyber-security-competition) (110 competitors total, from 24 colleges)

- [Titans of Cybersecurity DeCal](https://berke1337.berkeley.edu/decal/) - created and taught a one semester, student run class on cybersecurity. Speakers included Jeff Atwood (founder of Stack Overflow), Geoff Smalling (VP of Engineering at Flexport), Raj Date (1st director of the CFPB), Sourabh Satish (founder of Phantom Cyber, acq by Splunk)

- [ConsoleMe](http://github.com/netflix/consoleme) - made a (tiny) contribution by reading through the whole codebase and [outlining the file structure in the CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/Netflix/consoleme/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) -- to onboard new contributors faster
